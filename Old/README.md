# Acoustics
Repository to analyze signals from three (3) different hydrophones and estimate the positioning of a pinger in XY-coordinates.\

Hydrophones used:\
  Benthowave BII-7xxx series. (Unknown series of hydrophones...)\
  Note that at least one hydrophone may be damaged or destroyed
  
Hardware used for analyzis:\
  The analyzis is currently run on Nucleo-F76/ZI
  
Important notes:\
  The signals should be bandpassed-filtered both in hardware and in software
  

## Development

This project is developed using [Keil MDK-ARM](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm). To launch the project you therefore have to open the project file (*acoustics/ADCReadTest/MDK-ARM/ADCReadTest.uvprojx*).\



All of the files (and README's) for the year 2019/2020 can be found at:\
